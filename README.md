## Overview

Generative AI models are designed to create new content based on patterns learned from training data. This project explores the implementation of a transformer-based model to generate text, fine-tuned to produce coherent and context-aware outputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch – For building and training the model
  - Transformers – For using pre-trained transformer models
  - Pandas – For data manipulation
  - Numpy – For numerical computations
  - Matplotlib – For visualizing training progress

## Features

- Preprocessing and tokenization of text data.
- Fine-tuning transformer-based models (e.g., GPT, BERT).
- Text generation using context-based prediction.
- Ability to generate human-like responses to prompts.
- Customizable model parameters for tuning output quality.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Collected and preprocessed large-scale text data for training.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and tokenized text data for input into the model.
3. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuned a pre-trained transformer model on the custom dataset.
4. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Trained the model using GPUs for faster processing.
   - Evaluated model performance using loss and accuracy metrics.
5. **Text Generation**: Generated text based on input prompts using the trained model.

## Results

- The model successfully generates coherent and context-aware text.
- Achieved high accuracy and low perplexity on test data.
- Generated outputs are grammatically correct and contextually relevant.
